# Notes & Observations

This document contains raw thoughts, questions, and observations related to decision-making, AI, and systems design.

Entries here are intentionally unpolished.

---

## Observations

- Many AI failures are framing failures, not model failures
- More options often reduce decision quality
- Explicit trade-offs reduce regret
- Recording intent improves long-term judgment
- Speed without reflection compounds mistakes

---

## Open Questions

- How much context is “enough” for a decision?
- When does AI expansion become noise?
- Can decision quality be measured meaningfully?
- How do teams share decision memory without friction?

---

## Experiments (Ongoing)

- AI-assisted decision breakdowns
- Structured vs unstructured decision comparisons
- Human-only vs AI-assisted reasoning outcomes

---

## Notes to Self

- Avoid over-engineering
- Preserve human agency
- Optimize for learning, not correctness

---

This file will evolve organically.
